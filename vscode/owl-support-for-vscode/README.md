# Owl Support for VSCode

Basic syntax highlighting for Owl.

Rules can be added/removed/modified in the `syntaxes/owl.tmLanguage.json`. Rule names should ideally follow the [naming convention](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars#naming-conventions) so that standard themes can correctly apply the formatting.

## Installation

Copy this directory to `~/.vscode-server/extensions` and reload VSCode.

## TODOs

* Switch to [Semantic Tokenization](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide) at some point?
* Improve rule names
